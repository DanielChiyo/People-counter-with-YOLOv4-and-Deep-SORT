Counting feature added to The AI Guy's code. 
The original repository from The AI Guy link is https://github.com/theAIGuysCode/yolov4-deepsort
and the user's account link is : https://github.com/theAIGuysCode 

Counting feature added to make a people flux control.
Changes we're made to object_control.py file so it generates a csv file with people's entrances and exits after processing a video.

To run this repository, use The AI Guy's colab link [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]
and change the object_tracker.py to the code in this repository. Other option is to change the original Google Colab cell number 2 git clone link to this https://github.com/DanielChiyo/People-counter-with-YOLOv4-and-Deep-SORT instead.
